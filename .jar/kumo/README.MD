# Kumo - java word cloud


## Purpose of Kumo
The goal of **Kumo** is to create a powerful and user friendly Word Cloud library in **Java**.
Kumo can directly generate an image file, or return a BufferedImage. I plan on hosting it on Maven Central soon.


## Current Features

- Draw Rectangle, Circle or Image Overlay word clouds. Image Overlay will draw words over all non-transparent pixels.
Linear, Square-Root Font Scalars. Fully extendible.

- Variable Font Sizes.

- Word Rotation. Just provide a Start Angle, End Angle, and number of slices.

- Custom BackGround Color. Fully customizable BackGrounds coming soon.

- Word Padding.

- Load Custom Color Pallettes.

- Two Modes that of Colision and Padding: PIXEL_PERFECT and RECTANGLE.

- Polar Word Clouds. Draw two opposing word clouds in one image to easily compare/contrast date sets.

- Layered Word Clouds. Overlay multiple word clouds.

- WhiteSpace and Chinese Word Tokenizer. Fully extendible.

- Frequency Analyzer to tokenize, filter and compute word counts.
